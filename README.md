The main objective of our project is to design and implement a cost effective framework for a robust scalable and distributed data store that adapts to the dynamic scheduling needs with efficient work sharing for inter cluster communication and storage operation with heterogeneous systems. The main idea is conceived as cluster of Nodes and then cluster of clusters as the specified in the requirements to design a system which is decentralized, large, and heterogeneous platform. We have kept the system independent of the type of data storage used and file type which is being stored. One of the core issues to be addressed in this project is Scalability, how to be able to serve an increasing number of client requests, and still minimise the latency in a distributed system keeping in mind the huge load of client requests.

RING Architecuture A ring topology has all the nodes lined up in a ring forming a closed circuit. Every node in the ring has one inbound and one outbound edge. A Node is also known as Edge or Server.
